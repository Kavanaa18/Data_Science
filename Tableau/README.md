## Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Description

This project leverages Tableau to perform an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle data. It provides insights into various aspects such as the total number of vehicles, average electric range, total BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), top 10 vehicles, total vehicles by model, and total vehicles by state. The project also includes several filters for detailed analysis, including CAFV, EV type, model, and state.

## Installation

To view the Tableau dashboard, ensure you have Tableau installed.

## Usage

The Tableau dashboard includes several key visualizations and filters:

- **Total Number of Vehicles**: Displays the overall count of electric vehicles.
- **Average Electric Range**: Shows the average electric range across all vehicles.
- **Total BEV and PHEV**: Breaks down the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).
- **Top 10 Vehicles**: Lists the top 10 electric vehicles based on selected criteria.
- **Total Vehicles by Model**: Displays the distribution of vehicles by model.
- **Total Vehicles by State**: Shows the distribution of vehicles across different states.
- **Filters**: Includes options to filter data by CAFV, EV type, model, and state.

To use the dashboard, open the Tableau file and interact with the visualizations and filters to gain insights.
