This folder contains a comprehensive IPL data analysis performed in a Databricks environment using Apache Spark. The dataset was sourced from AWS, and I executed various queries utilizing Spark SQL to extract and manipulate the data efficiently. Additionally, I conducted data visualization using Seaborn and Pandas DataFrame for in-depth data analysis and insightful graphical representations.

The primary objective of this project was to acquire a foundational understanding of Spark, Databricks environment, and AWS storage solutions. Through this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in big data processing, data querying, and visualization, as well as to gain practical experience in managing and analyzing large datasets within a cloud-based platform.This project was completed with the help of various online sources, including YouTube tutorials, which provided valuable guidance and insights throughout the process.
