## Titanic Data analysis and prediction

This folder contains a comprehensive Titanic data analysis and prediction project performed using Python in a Jupyter environment. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and I conducted various functions such as data preprocessing, data analysis, and visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and invalid data to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable. Additionally, I performed feature extraction and selection to identify the most significant variables for the prediction model.

Pandas was employed for efficient data manipulation, enabling smooth data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation processes. For the predictive modeling aspect, I utilized logistic regression to train the model. This involved splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics. The model's accuracy and other performance measures were thoroughly assessed to ensure its reliability.

The primary aim of this project was to get a practical knowledge on data analysis and predictive modeling using Python, as well as to become proficient in using a Jupyter environment for such tasks. Through this project, I also aimed to enhance my skills in data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation, thereby gaining practical experience in managing and analyzing datasets. This project provided a solid foundation in these essential data science techniques.
