## Sonar vs Mine Data Analysis and Prediction

This folder contains the Sonar vs Mine data analysis and prediction project using Python in a Jupyter environment. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. The analysis involves comprehensive data visualization using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Pandas is utilized for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.

In this project, I have performed various essential functions including:

Data preprocessing
Data analysis and visualization
Handling missing values
Handling invalid values
Feature extraction and feature selection
Model training and evaluation
For model training, I employed logistic regression to predict the classification of sonar signals. This project provides a thorough approach to handling and analyzing the dataset, ensuring robust and reliable predictive modeling.
